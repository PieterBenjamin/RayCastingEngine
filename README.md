# RayCastingEngine
Python-implemented raycasting engine

As an intro to computer graphics, I decided to implement a ray casting engine  
after watching [a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOCQfxRQ2pY&t=601s) and finding myself interested. My friend [Nik](https://github.com/NikolasUntoten) helped  
as usual with an ear and fresh perspectives. I chose to use Python for this  
project since the [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/news) library so I didn't have to implement anything  
related to keyboard listeners or graphics panels.
